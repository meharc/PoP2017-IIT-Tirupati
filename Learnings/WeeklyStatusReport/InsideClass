What you learnt inside the class?

Week1

#1 In the class ,we started with trying to covert natural language sentence to symbols and mathematical expressions, thus giving us a new way of approach.
#2 We thought about various problems in the present that are really specific instead of targeting on a general problem and tried to get a solution for them.
#3 Discussion regarding the change necessary from thinking how to do a procedure to what is first required by the user which is more important, was held.
#4 Further , we discussed what paradigm is? it is a way of thinking.
#5 Different prgramming languages, from basic including C to object oriented languages like C++,java to functional languages like R,hascal were introduced.

Week 2

#1 We learnt about different programming language paradigms like imperative,object-oriented,declarative,functional,multiparadigmed.
#2 We discussed how ASTRACTION is an important concept. 
#3 Scaling the levels of a problem is an appropriate and efficient way to approach the problem!
#4 We learnt about how both syntax(language grammar) and semantics(expression meaning)are equally important.
#5 We saw the entire compilation process that includes source code, preprocessing it,lexical analyzing,syntax analyzing,formation of abstract syntax tree,optimization,conversion to machine code.
#6 We discussed how interpreter is different from a compiler interms of how easy access it has, it gets to know the errorquickly instead of going through entire program like the compiler.
#7 Wr read about BACKUS NAUR FORM containg non-terminals,terminals and grammar.
